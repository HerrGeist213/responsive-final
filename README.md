### The Design
---
**Anchor Links**<br>
The links are designed to bring the user to a section within the landing page with the information they need.

**Dark Mode**<br>
The site is equipped with a JavaScript-driven Dark Mode button for all devices. 
<br><br>

### The Content
---
**Goals & Users**<br>
The intention of this site is to attract users who are looking to take a vacation, but would like to takea less conventional trip. It offers voyages to South and Central America, but mainly European ports of call.

**Products & Services**<br>
Cruises and ports of call in the hottest destinations. All cruises offer various ammenity packages at various prices, but all packages are intended to provide the best experience possible at the price point.
<br><br>

### The Build
---
The build was not difficult, but that's mainly due to the instructions throughout the Front-End course, as well as the starter code. Some of the CSS was a little tricky to figure out, but it's mainly done through variables with the cool parts being powerd by JS.
<br><br>

### Summary
---
These sites are always fun to build and I do love to travel, so this was right up my alley. I am glad that we were assigned this today. It really shows what can be done with a short deadline.
